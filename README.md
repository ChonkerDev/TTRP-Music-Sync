# TTRP-Music-Sync
Requires yt-dlp and ffmpeg.
This is intended to be used with friends. Don't setup VPN's with people you don't know.

Instructions:
1) download yt-dlp.exe from https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
2) download ffmpeg.exe from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds
3) start music sync app
4) close it
5) navigate to the music sync app root folder and place the yt-dlp.exe and ffmpeg.exe into the "External Tools" folder
6) Use a VPN of your choice to allow connections, personally I like Tailscale and Radmin. Alternatively you can port forward, but VPN's are much easier.
7) When connecting as a client, the ip of the host should be whatever the host IP is shown in the VPN (ask the host for the IP)
